                        “Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.”

                        St. Dymphna is the patron Saint of runaways, psychiatrists, people with anxiety, mental illness and depression, as well as their caregivers. I founded the Chapel in thanks to St. Dymphna for a miracle that she worked in my own life. Here at the Chapel we have many different altars, all dedicated to God, the Saints and the Angels, as well as to our dear ones in spirit.

                        St. Dymphna was the daughter of a 7th century Celtic King and his Christian wife. When Dymphna was 14 years old, her mother died and her father became insane with grief. He eventually decided that he should marry his daughter, as she looked just like her mother. Dymphna was a devout girl, and she knew that this was wrong, so she ran away with her priest, Father Gerebernus, and landed in Belgium in the town of Gheel. In the town, Dyphna and the priest set up a ministry to help and heal people with mental illness. There are countless reports of miraculous healings at the Shrine of St. Dymphna in Gheel, which continue to this day. St. Dymphna is also the patron Saint of psychiatrists, and a world class hospital for mental illness is now on the site of her shrine in Gheel.

                        Eventually, her father tracked her down. His men killed Father Gerebernus, and when Dymphna resisted her father’s advances, he drew his sword and cut her head off. It is said that the mental patients that witnessed her death were immediately and miraculously healed. She now stands guard over us all in heaven, and can be petitioned for help and healing in all of these areas of stress, anxiety, depression and mental illness, as well as caregiver’s concerns.

                        Many people in this day and age are unfamiliar with Spiritualism, and what it means to be a Spiritualist. The Theosophist Society, founded by Madam Blavatsky and Emma Hardinge Britten in 1875 set out the basic tenets of the Church.

                        Below are the Seven Principles of Spiritualism, as given to Emma Hardinge Britten in 1871 by the communicating spirit of Robert Owen.

                        Basically, a Spiritualist believes that we all have a chance to do the right thing, make the proper choices, correct our Karma and connect with God in all we do, with the help of our guides, Angels and dear ones in spirit. The belief in life after death is very important to a Spiritualist, and spirit contact is a very key part of this Christian denomination.
