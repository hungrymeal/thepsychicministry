                    “Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. For
                    one
                    who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters
                    mysteries in the Spirit. On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their
                    upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself,
                    but
                    the one who prophesies builds up the church. Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even
                    more
                    to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless
                    someone
                    interprets, so that the church may be built up.”

                    St. Dymphna is the patron Saint of runaways, psychiatrists, people with anxiety, mental illness
                    and
                    depression, as well as their caregivers. I founded the Chapel in thanks to St. Dymphna for a
                    miracle
                    that she worked in my own life. Here at the Chapel we have many different altars, all dedicated
                    to
                    God, the Saints and the Angels, as well as to our dear ones in spirit.

                    St. Dymphna was the daughter of a 7th century Celtic King and his Christian wife. When Dymphna
                    was
                    14 years old, her mother died and her father became insane with grief. He eventually decided
                    that he
                    should marry his daughter, as she looked just like her mother. Dymphna was a devout girl, and
                    she
                    knew that this was wrong, so she ran away with her priest, Father Gerebernus, and landed in
                    Belgium
                    in the town of Gheel. In the town, Dyphna and the priest set up a ministry to help and heal
                    people
                    with mental illness. There are countless reports of miraculous healings at the Shrine of St.
                    Dymphna
                    in Gheel, which continue to this day. St. Dymphna is also the patron Saint of psychiatrists, and
                    a
                    world class hospital for mental illness is now on the site of her shrine in Gheel.

                <p>
                    Eventually, her father tracked her down. His men killed Father Gerebernus, and when Dymphna
                    resisted
                    her father’s advances, he drew his sword and cut her head off. It is said that the mental
                    patients
                    that witnessed her death were immediately and miraculously healed. She now stands guard over us
                    all
                    in heaven, and can be petitioned for help and healing in all of these areas of stress, anxiety,
                    depression and mental illness, as well as caregiver’s concerns.

                    Many people in this day and age are unfamiliar with Spiritualism, and what it means to be a
                    Spiritualist. The Theosophist Society, founded by Madam Blavatsky and Emma Hardinge Britten in
                    1875
                    set out the basic tenets of the Church.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are the Seven Principles of Spiritualism, as given to Emma Hardinge Britten in 1871 by the
                    communicating spirit of Robert Owen.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Fatherhood of God</li>
                    <li>The Brotherhood of Man.</li>
                    <li>Communion of Spirits and the Ministry of Angels</li>
                    <li>Continuous Existence of the Human Soul.</li>
                    <li>Personal Responsibility.</li>
                    <li>Compensation and Retribution hereafter for all Good and Evil Deeds done on Earth</li>
                    <li>Eternal Progress open to every Human Soul</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Basically, a Spiritualist believes that we all have a chance to do the right thing, make the
                    proper
                    choices, correct our Karma and connect with God in all we do, with the help of our guides,
                    Angels
                    and dear ones in spirit. The belief in life after death is very important to a Spiritualist, and
                    spirit contact is a very key part of this Christian denomination.
