                    Psychic Readings:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use a combination of Clairvoyance, Clairaudience, and the Tarot in our readings. And yes, we
                    really do gaze into a crystal ball! When you call, please give us your first name, and your first
                    question. Please make a list with all of your questions that you want answered to save yourself time
                    and money. We want you to be armed with the knowledge that you need to turn your dreams into
                    reality. One question usually takes about 10 minutes to fully answer, and once we finish with one
                    question we can move on quickly to another. Please have your questions ready so that you don’t
                    forget to ask anything that you are concerned about, and remember, only God is 100% accurate. The
                    future is always able to be altered with our actions and intentions.
                </p>

                    Want to know a secret that the super rich and celebrities don’t want you to know about? Most of them
                    consult psychics and astrologers to give themselves an edge!! We are good friends with a Hollywood
                    Psychic who reads for many of the entertainment elite, and her clients would never dream of making a
                    move before consulting her to make sure that they were making the best decision. Rockefeller and his
                    elite contemporaries all consulted psychics and astrologers before making business deals. Lady Eaton
                    actually had a psychic reading room especially constructed in her country estate, complete with an
                    astrological ceiling painted in midnight blue and gold! They used spiritualists to help them attract
                    their vast wealth and success, and you can too!

                    change the future to better reflect our needs and desires through prayer work and petitions to God,
                    the Saints and the Angels. God gives us the free will to choose our destiny, and when we back it up
                    with proper energy, that choosing is where the magic lives. We can coach you with any area that you
                    would like improvement in and working together for the highest good, we pray that we can turn your
                    fondest dreams into reality. As the child of a loving God, you deserve it! Claim your happiness

                <p>
                    We understand how difficult life can be. We can coach you to change your world for the better
                    through learning how to petition the Saints, pray to the proper Angels, or simply unburden yourself
                    by getting something off your chest, and asking for an impartial opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All our readings and spiritual coaching sessions are completely confidential, and believe us, we
                    have heard everything! There is no problem too severe that God cannot heal. As a free offering from
                    the Chapel Candle Ministry for our clients, tell us what you desire, and we will write your petition
                    personally to be set on one of our altars at the Chapel of St. Dymphna. We will light the proper
                    candle for you, and say the proper prayers. Our prayer work on your behalf is always free with a
                    session. We will also give you homework, perhaps a Psalm or prayer to repeat daily. Most candles
                    that we use will burn for 120 hours or so, and when the candle is burnt out we will write our
                    spiritual impressions on your petition, so that we can relay them to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our clients usually phone back in about 10 days after we set the lights for them, and at that time
                    we can tell them our messages from Spirit regarding their petitions. All of our readings and
                    spiritual coaching sessions start with a blessing for you, to clear up any negative energies and get
                    your best foot forward on your path. When the energy is calm and centered on Spirit, we can work
                    effectively for the highest good of all concerned, which is always the goal in our spiritual work.
