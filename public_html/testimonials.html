                    Tracey Leigh is probably the best intuitive I've ever been to. One visit, I took in a photo of a man I'd just started seeing. There wasn't anything special or revealing about the photo - it was just a black & white, head/shoulder shot from a photo booth. But from that photo, she was able to pick up that he was planning on getting his MBA… which he was. He'd actually just told me about it the day before! She also sensed (correctly) that he had some serious mommy issues - so thank you for helping me dodge that bullet, because it turned out he was indeed tied to his mother's apron strings! But what I like most about going to Tracey for readings is that it's like going to a friend or a next-door neighbour - she's as real and down-to-earth as they come. I highly recommend her!” - Siobhain K.

                    She was bang on- predicting an outcome that at the time seemed completely impossible. So much so, that I initially thought – nah, this can’t be right. When it played out EXACTLY as she said, I was left slack jawed. Truly, it was bizarre. Excellent reading! – Mel C.
