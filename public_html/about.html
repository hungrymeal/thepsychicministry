                <p id="p_hight">I have been working as a Psychic Medium since the age of fourteen, when I learned how to hone my gifts through the use of Tarot and the teachings of the Spiritualist Church. I was ordained as a non denominational minister in 2010, and I believe that we are all children of the same God. One of my ancestors was a founder of a Christian Church in Jamaica which still stands today, and I feel that I am carrying on the family tradition of spiritual work by founding The Psychic Ministry and the Chapel of St. Dymphna.
                </p>
                <p> Jesus taught that if a person had the ability to prophesy, then that person had the responsibility to share it with others to bring them comfort and encouragement ( Corinthians 14:1-40). I am pleased and honored to be able to share my gift with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For many years I did readings at the Psychic Expos and fairs. I have appeared on radio and have been interviewed in newspapers and on television. As well as studying Spiritualism, I have studied Native American spirituality, the Zohar, Kabbalah and Hoodoo Rootwork. In Catholic girl’s school, I excelled in theology and this eventually led to me being ordained as a non denominational minister. Many of the candle rituals and prayer petitions that I use are deeply rooted in Hoodoo, (which is not Voodoo) and I feel that my Caribbean heritage has helped me in this area of petitioning, which is pretty much a spiritualist’s way of saying “affirmations” or “the Law of Attraction” in which the basic principle is “that what you desire, desires you.” I am considered “Lady hearted”, which means that I do not recommend any prayer work that harms, or forces people to do something against their will. I coach my clients to use the Psalms, the Bible, Angel writing techniques and ritual candles to give our prayers real power

                <p>
                    I am here for you, keeping the vigil at The Chapel of St. Dymphna, to support and uplift you on this path that we call Life. Let’s make it a fantastic and worthwhile journey. Give us a call today!
