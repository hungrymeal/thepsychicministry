                <p>I believe that everything happens for a reason, and Spirit has brought you to this place to tell
                   you
                   that you are beloved, and God, the Angels, the Saints, and Spirit want to help you manifest your
                   fondest dreams and turn them into reality. They are always there for you, but like a loving
                   friend,
                   they will not step in to help unless they are asked (that would be meddling). The good news is
                   that
                   when God, the Saints and the Angels are petitioned with proper prayer and intent, miracles can
                   happen.</p>
                <p> I should know. I have seen the miraculous my entire life, and I founded The Psychic Ministry and
                    The
                    Chapel of St. Dymphna Independent Spiritualist Church as an offering to God, the Saints and
                    Angels
                    for their miraculous intercession in a very tragic situation. I am caregiver to a loved one who
                    has
                    mental illness. My patient grew steadily more delusional over the years and repeatedly refused
                    psychiatric treatment. After receiving contact from some people that my patient was afraid of,
                    he
                    decided that he must disappear to protect the rest of our family, which he did, without a trace.
                    To
                    say that I was horrified was an understatement; my loved one was not functional in any way,
                    shape or
                    form, and I was very concerned that he would commit suicide or get himself killed. I also had
                    experienced a psychic dream about two months before, where a woman in a long dress (I know now
                    that
                    this was St. Dymphna) took me to psychiatric hospital and beckoned me to look into a window into
                    a
                    room. My loved one was inside, looking completely disconnected with reality, but I didn’t get a
                    bad
                    feeling about the whole thing. More like relief. When I woke up, I remembered the dream and
                    wondered
                    how that would ever happen, and pretty much forgot about it. I knew that it meant something, as
                    I
                    regularly have psychic dreams that come to pass, but my patient was so frighteningly resistant
                    to
                    conventional medical treatment that I was at my wits end.</p>

            <div class="span4">
                <p>At this point, I realized that I needed supernatural intervention, and I began to petition St.
                   Dymphna, who is the patron saint of runaways, psychiatrists, anxious, depressed or mentally ill
                   patients and
                   their caregivers. With special prayers, written petitions, proper candle burning, and focused
                   intent,
                   I prayed like never before.</p>
                <img src="assets/indexColumn1Photo1.jpg" class="imgborder">
                <p>Within five days, St. Dymphna worked the biggest miracle that I have ever witnessed, and it will
                   stand as the most astonishing time of my life. I will never forget it.</p>
                <img src="assets/indexColumn1Photo2.jpg" class="imgborder"/>
            </div>
            <div class="span4">
                <p>Five days after I began my petitions, I got a phone call from a police officer. He had been
                   called
                   to a church by a minister, in a town two hours away. My loved one had come forward during the
                   service
                   and asked for an exorcism. Luckily, the church goers realized that he was in a psychotic state,
                   and phoned the police, who had him involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. He stayed
                   there
                   for a month, where he got a diagnosis and proper medication. As the days went by, it was like he
                   was
                   coming out of a fog, and he became balanced and lucid. It was truly a miracle.</p>
                <img src="assets/indexColumn2Photo1.jpg" class="imgborder"/>
                <p>St. Dymphna had answered my prayers. She had placed my loved one with people of God, who
                   recognized
                   his distress, and this led him to the miraculous healing that he has experienced with the help of
                   a
                   fantastic doctor and the proper medication.</p>

            <div class="span4">
                <p>My loved one is now a functioning member of our family. He knows the importance of taking his
                   medication and keeping his thoughts uplifted and positive. It has truly been a miracle in our
                   lives,
                   and I hope
                   to spread the word through this ministry to help others turn their dreams into reality…you just
                   need
                   to know how to ask! Never give up! The good that you desire in your life also desires you!! The
                   word
                   “de sire” is latin for “of the Father”, and I have been taught that our desires are put within us
                   by
                   God,as he knows that we can achieve them, and he wants us to have the highest and the best in our
                   lives, as children of a loving Father.</p>
